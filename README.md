Hi my name is Shincy Mary Mathew. I habve completed my M.Sc Mathematics from Stella Maris College , currently pursuing a Diploma in Data Science from IITM. <br />
The uncanny ability of YouTube to suggest the next binge-worthy video, or the way Netflix curates a movie list that mirrors my deepest cinematic desires that ignited my fascination with data science. It was the realization that a complex system of information, invisible to the naked eye, was quietly arranging these experiences. This revelation led me down the path of data science, where I could untangle the web of this intricate information structure.It's a field brimming with possibilities, one where seemingly random data transforms into meaningful insights, shaping the way we interact with technology and the world around us.<br />
**Project 1:**<br />
**Predicting food ratings based on recipes using ML models**- Built machine learning models to predict recipe ratings using user comments and metadata. LightGBM achieved the highest accuracy (78.58%) and excelled at identifying highly-rated recipes. While effective overall, the model could be improved for specific rating categories.<br />
**Project Goal**: Predicting recipe ratings.<br />
**Methods**: User comments, metadata, and machine learning models (LightGBM, XGBoost, etc.).<br />
**Results**: LightGBM achieved the best accuracy (78.58%) and performed well for high ratings. Room for improvement exists for certain rating categories.<br />
**Applications**: Personalized recipe recommendations on recipe platforms.<br />

****Project 2:****<br />
**DataVisualisation_Forage_Tata_Onlineretail**- We analyzed the Tata online retail data to understand seasonal trends, top revenue countries, and popular products using data visualization. These insights can inform strategic decisions for inventory, marketing, and international expansion.<br />
Data source: Tata online retail dataset<br />
Analysis method: Data visualization using Tableau <br />
Key findings: Seasonal trends, top revenue countries, popular products <br />
Impact: Informs strategic decisions (inventory, marketing, international expansion) for business growth and profitability.
