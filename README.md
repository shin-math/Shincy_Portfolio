# Shincy_Portfolio
Hi my name is Shincy Mary Mathew. I habve completed my M.Sc Mathematics from Stella Maris College , currently pursuing a Diploma in Data Science from IITM. The uncanny ability of YouTube to suggest the next binge-worthy video, or the way Netflix curates a movie list that mirrors my deepest cinematic desires that ignited my fascination with data science. It was the realization that a complex system of information, invisible to the naked eye, was quietly arranging these experiences. It's a field brimming with possibilities, one where seemingly random data transforms into meaningful insights, shaping the way we interact with technology and the world around us.
